            <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
            <p class="about-head">Lorem Ipsum is Simply dummy text of the Printing and typesetting
                industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's Standard dummy
                text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a gallery of 
                type and Scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
                Survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
                typesetting, remaning essentially unchanged. It was Popularised in 
                the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem
                Ipsum Passages, and more recently with desktop Publishing 
                software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
